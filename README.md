# Error-Analysis
This code simulates an error analysis method excercise explained at numerical calculus class

Given an array of approximations and a true valor, calculate iteratively the error percentage of each approximation until the array end.
Each calculation (true error, relative error, percentage relative error and percentage approximate error) is represented in its respective functions.

I'd like to change it to receive any number by user input. I'll create a new branch for it later...
